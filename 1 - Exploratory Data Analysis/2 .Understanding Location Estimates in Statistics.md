# Estimates of Location
Variables with measured or count data might have thousands of distinct values. A basic step in exploring your data is getting a *typical value* for
each feature.

Some of the estimates of location/point are:
- Mean
- Weighted Mode
- Median
- Percentile
- Weighted Median
- Trimmed mean
- Robust
- Outlier

## Mean
- The most basic estimate of location is the mean, or average value.
- The mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. 

Table 1: sample dataframe as df

|   Name   | Age |     City     |
|:--------:|:---:|:------------:|
|  Alice   |  25 |   New York   |
|   Bob    |  30 | Los Angeles  |
| Charlie  |  35 |   Chicago    |
|  David   |  28 |   Houston    |

```python
#Implementation in Python
import pandas as pd

# Calculate the mean for the 'Age' column
age_mean = df['Age'].mean()

# Print the mean
print("Mean Age:", age_mean)
```
```R
# Calculate the mean for the 'Age' column
age_mean <- mean(df$Age)

# Print the mean
cat("Mean Age:", age_mean)
```

## Trimmed Mean
A variation of the mean is trimmed mean. It calculates the mean of a dataset after a certain percentage of extreme values (usually the lowest and/or highest values) have been removed or "trimmed" from the dataset. This is done to reduce the influence of outliers or extreme observations on the calculated mean. The idea is to obtain a more robust estimate of the central tendency of the data by mitigating the impact of extreme values.
<br><br/>
It's important to choose an appropriate trimming percentage based on the characteristics of your data and the objectives of your analysis. Common trimming percentages include 5%, 10%, or 20%, but the choice may vary depending on the specific use case and the nature of the data.

Table 2: sample dataframe as df

| Value | 
|:-----:|
|   1   |  
|   2   |  
|   3   |  
|   4   |
|  100  |
|  200  |
|  300  |
|  400  |


```python
import pandas as pd

# Define the trimming percentage (e.g., 10%)
trim_percentage = 10

# Calculate the number of data points to trim from each end
trim_count = int(len(df) * (trim_percentage / 100) / 2)

# Sort the DataFrame by 'Value' column
sorted_df = df.sort_values(by='Value')

# Trim the extreme values
trimmed_df = sorted_df.iloc[trim_count:-trim_count]

# Calculate the trimmed mean
trimmed_mean = trimmed_df['Value'].mean()

# Print the trimmed mean
print("Trimmed Mean:", trimmed_mean)
```

```R
# Define the trimming percentage (e.g., 10%)
trim_percentage <- 10

# Calculate the number of data points to trim from each end
trim_count <- round(nrow(df) * (trim_percentage / 100) / 2)

# Sort the data frame by 'Value' column
sorted_data <- df[order(df$Value), ]

# Trim the extreme values
trimmed_data <- sorted_data[(trim_count + 1):(nrow(sorted_data) - trim_count), ]

# Calculate the trimmed mean
trimmed_mean <- mean(trimmed_data$Value)

# Print the trimmed mean
cat("Trimmed Mean:", trimmed_mean)
```
