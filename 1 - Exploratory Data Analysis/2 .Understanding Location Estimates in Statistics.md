# Estimates of Location
Variables with measured or count data might have thousands of distinct values. A basic step in exploring your data is getting a *typical value* for
each feature.

Some of the estimates of location/point are:
- Mean
- Weighted Mean
- Median
- Weighted Median
- Trimmed mean


## Mean
- The most basic estimate of location is the mean, or average value.
- The mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. 

Table 1: sample dataframe as df

|   Name   | Age |     City     |
|:--------:|:---:|:------------:|
|  Alice   |  25 |   New York   |
|   Bob    |  30 | Los Angeles  |
| Charlie  |  35 |   Chicago    |
|  David   |  28 |   Houston    |

```python
#Implementation in Python
import pandas as pd
df['Age'].mean()
```
```R
Implementation in R
mean(df$Age)
```

## Trimmed Mean
A variation of the mean is trimmed mean. It calculates the mean of a dataset after a certain percentage of extreme values (usually the lowest and/or highest values) have been removed or "trimmed" from the dataset. This is done to reduce the influence of outliers or extreme observations on the calculated mean. The idea is to obtain a more robust estimate of the central tendency of the data by mitigating the impact of extreme values.

It's important to choose an appropriate trimming percentage based on the characteristics of your data and the objectives of your analysis. Common trimming percentages include 5%, 10%, or 20%, but the choice may vary depending on the specific use case and the nature of the data.

Table 2: sample dataframe as df

| Value | Population |
|:-----:|:----------:|
|   1   |    10      |
|   2   |     4      |
|   3   |     21     |
|   4   |     7      |
|  100  |     1      |
|  200  |     2      |
|  300  |     3      |
|  400  |     4      |


```python
#Implementation of trimmed mean in Python
import pandas as pd
trim_mean(df['Value'],0.1)
```

```R
#Implementation of trimmed mean in R
mean(df[['Value']],trim=0.1)
```

## Median & Robust Estimates
The median is a statistical measure used to find the middle value in a data set when the values are arranged in order. It divides the data into two equal halves, with half of the values lying below it and half above it. To calculate the median, you first arrange the data in ascending or descending order and then select the middle value. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.

### Example of Why Median is Better Than Mean at Times:

Consider a small group of people with their respective annual incomes:

Person A: $30,000
Person B: $35,000
Person C: $40,000
Person D: $45,000
Person E: $1,000,000

If we calculate the mean (average) income for this group, it would be:

Mean Income = (30,000 + 35,000 + 40,000 + 45,000 + 1,000,000) / 5 = $230,000

The mean income, in this case, is heavily influenced by the outlier (Person E) with the extremely high income of $1,000,000. As a result, the mean income of $230,000 does not accurately represent the typical income within this group.

Now, let's calculate the median income:

Arrange the incomes in ascending order: $30,000, $35,000, $40,000, $45,000, $1,000,000.
The middle value is $40,000.
The median income in this case is $40,000. Unlike the mean, the median is not significantly affected by extreme values or outliers. It provides a better representation of the central tendency of the data, especially when the data set contains outliers or highly skewed distributions.

In summary, the median is often a better measure than the mean when dealing with data sets that have extreme values, outliers, or skewed distributions, as it is less sensitive to these extreme values and provides a more robust representation of the typical value in the data.

#### Weighted Median
A weighted median is a statistical measure that considers the significance or weight of individual data points when finding the middle value. For example, in a dataset of test scores, if some scores are considered more important than others, a weighted median would prioritize those important scores in determining the central value. It's a useful tool in various fields, including finance and healthcare, where not all data points carry the same weight, allowing for more accurate central tendency calculations.

### Outliers
The median is referred to as a robust estimate of location since it's not infleunced by outliers that could skew the results. 

__*Def*__: An outlier is any value that is very distant from the other values in a data set.

Outlier does not make a data invalid, but they are often the result of data errors such as mixing diff units(meters and km) or bad reading of sensor.

__*Note*__: Trimmed mean can also be used to exclude outliers and to calculate point estimate of location, but when the sample set is small, it wouldn't be a healthy habit to remove data.

```python
#Implemention of median and weighted median from table 2 using Python
df['Value'].median() #median

wquantiles.median(df['Value'], weights=df['Population']) #weighted median using numpy
```
```R
#Implemention of median and weighted median from table 2 using R
median(df[['Value']] #Median

#We need to install package called matrixStats
library('matrixStats')
weightedMedian(df[['Value']],w=df[['Population']])
```
---
## Weighted Mean
Weighted mean assigns different weights to values in a dataset based on their importance. It helps resolve outliers by giving less influence to extreme values. For example, in test scores, an outlier's score may be weighted less, resulting in a more representative average.

```python
#Implementation of Weighted Mean from table 2 using Python
import numpy as np
np.average(df['Value'],weights=df['Population'])
```
```R
#Implementation of Weighted Mean from table 2 using Python
weighted.mean(df[['Value']], w=df[['Population']])
```
