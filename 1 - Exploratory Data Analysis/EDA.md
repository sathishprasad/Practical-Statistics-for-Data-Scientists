## Elements of Structured Data
Data comes from many sources - sensor measurements, events, texts, images etc. Majority of these data are unstructured and to convert these data into actonable
information, the unstructured raw data needs to be processed and manipulated into a structured form. 

There are two basic type of structured data <br>
- Numeric data
- Categorical data

### Numeric data 
- Numeric data are data that are expressed on a numeric scale.
- Numeric data comes in two forms
  - __Continuous Data__
    - Data that can take on any value in an interval. Ex - Wind speed, time duration.
  - __Discrete Data__
    - Data that can take on only integer values. Ex - Count of occurance of event, age etc. 
### Categorical data
- Data that can take on only a specific set of values rpresenting a set of possible categories.(Synonyms: Enums,factors, nominal, enumerated)
- Categorical data comes in two forms
  - __Binary data__
    - A special case of categorical data with just two categories of values. Ex - 0/1,true/false,male/female etc.
  - __Ordinal data__
    - Categorical data that has an explicit ordering. Ex - Customer start rating of 1-5.

### Advantages of ordering the data
- Data typing in software acts as a signal to the software on how to process the data.
- Knowing the data is categorical can act as a signal to analysts on how to perform actions with the data.
- Storage and indexing can be optimised.
